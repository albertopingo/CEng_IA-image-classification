#We are using 4/5 train directories for training, and the remaining for validation.

# My validation directory is **train5**

## Calculating the directory for validation 
(I'm doing the projeto alone, so i will use both my last two digits)

00000XY
(X+Y) % 5 + 1 = trainZ


Student number: 2202145
x = 4 | y = 5
(4 + 5) % 5 + 1 = 5 = train5
